The UEFA Member Association ggbump project is the opporuntiy for improving my data visualizations in ggplot2.
  * Use rvest and polite libraries to web scrape [UEFA Member Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient#Men's_Club_coefficient)
  * Use dpylr, readr, and stringr to pre-process and clean the data after web scrapping
  * Use ggplot, ggbump, ggflags, magick, and cowplot to create a plot to illustrate the UEFA's Cofficients among Nordic countries

4) [***English Premier League Goals Scored & Conceded Charts***](https://github.com/slopers-pinches/football_soccer/tree/main/Goals%20Scored%20Conceded%20Charts)

This project gives me the opportunity to create small multiple bar charts showing Goals Scored and Conceded by English Premier League Clubs from 2021-22 season. The data was web scraped using Selenium in Python and visualized in Tableau.
  * Use Selenium to web scrape [SoccerSTATS](https://www.soccerstats.com/timing.asp?league=england)
  * Use panadas for data preprocessing and manipulation
  * Use Tableau to create the small multiple bar charts

I built an Expected Goal (xG) Race Chart to show the running sum of xG goals between BVB and Werder Bremen. xG is a metric of the likelihood of a scoring opportunity that may result in a goal. This project allows me to improve my Tableau viz and web scraping skills.
  * Use BeautifulSoup to webscrape [Understats](https://understat.com/match/19364)
  * Use panadas for data preprocessing and manipulation
  * Use Tableau to create a time series plot
    - Refer to [How to Make an xG Flow Chart in Tableau](https://ayushnarayan-95320.medium.com/how-to-make-an-xg-flow-chart-in-tableau-d85ea679117a)
